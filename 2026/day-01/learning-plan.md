•	What is your understanding of DevOps and Cloud Engineering?
DevOps = Culture + Tools + Automation
It’s about making software delivery faster, safer, and more reliable by improving collaboration between:
👉 Developers
👉 Testers
👉 Operations (infra/server team)
Main goals of DevOps:
•	Faster releases 🚀
•	Fewer bugs in production
•	Easy rollback if something fails
•	Automation instead of manual work
What a DevOps engineer actually does:
•	Automate build & deployment (CI/CD pipelines)
•	Manage servers using code (Infrastructure as Code)
•	Monitor applications
•	Handle deployments, scaling, and failures
Cloud Engineering – My understanding
Cloud Engineering = Designing and managing infrastructure on cloud platforms
It’s about using cloud providers like:
☁ AWS
☁ Azure
☁ GCP
Instead of physical servers (data center), everything is on cloud.
What a Cloud Engineer does:
•	Create & manage virtual servers
•	Set up networking (VPC, subnets, load balancers)
•	Storage (S3, Blob, EBS)
•	Security (IAM, firewalls, encryption)
•	Scaling systems up/down based on traffic
Focus:
•	Reliability
•	Security
•	Cost optimization
•	High availability
Cloud = WHERE the app runs
DevOps = HOW the app is built & deployed

•	Why you are starting learning DevOps & Cloud?
•	“I started learning DevOps and Cloud because modern applications are mostly deployed on cloud platforms and delivered using DevOps practices. I want to upgrade my skills to match current industry needs and work on complete software delivery, not just development or testing.
•	With DevOps and Cloud, I can understand the full lifecycle of an application — from code commit to deployment and monitoring. This helps in improving automation, system reliability, and faster releases.
•	Also, cloud and DevOps roles have good career growth and are in high demand, so learning these skills will help me build a future-proof career in IT.”

•	“I am starting to learn DevOps and Cloud because as a tester, I already work with CI/CD pipelines, builds, and deployments. I want to move one step ahead and handle automation, infrastructure, and deployment myself.
•	By learning DevOps and Cloud, I can contribute more to the project by automating test execution in pipelines, managing test environments, and ensuring stable releases. This will help me grow from QA into a DevOps/Cloud-oriented role.”
•	Main goals is for salary hike and 20LPA package in next year.

Where do you want to reach?
“I want to move from a testing-focused role into a DevOps and Cloud role where I can work on automation, deployment, and infrastructure. My aim is to become a DevOps Engineer who understands both application quality and system reliability, and can help teams release software faster and more safely.”
How you will stay consistent every single day?
“I will stay consistent by integrating DevOps learning with my current work. For example, I will practice CI/CD pipelines for test automation and use cloud platforms to create test environments. This way, my learning will be practical and directly connected to my job, which will keep me motivated and consistent.”
